# ERA5

This is an attempt to reproduce the experiment of
[inserting one trillion records](https://aliramadhan.me/2024/03/31/trillion-rows.html)
of
[historical weather data](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)
into a database. Only this time the data is inserted into
[Victoria Metrics TSDB](https://victoriametrics.com/).
